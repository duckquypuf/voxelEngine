A *very* simple minecraft "clone" (work in progress). 
This **was** helped out with ai but most of the learning from [Learn OpenGl](https://www.learnopengl.com/).
I have implemented greedy meshing per chunk, a player movement and collision system (based on gamemode) and implemented some imgui to help me.
